# Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of data analyst/Engineer roles in Sri Lanka and around the world, focusing on top-paying positions, high-demand skills, and the intersection where skill demand aligns with higher salaries. Using real-world job posting data and structured SQL queries (available in the [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)), the study offers valuable insights into current trends shaping the data analytics job market.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
- What are the top-paying data analyst/engineer jobs?
- What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
- What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
- Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
- What are the most optimal skills to learn?

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **SQL** was used as the core tool for querying the database and extracting key insights from the job posting data.

- **PostgreSQL** served as the database management system, suitable for handling and managing structured data efficiently.

- **Visual Studio Code** was used to write and execute SQL queries, providing a streamlined environment for development.

- **Git** and **GitHub** were used for version control and collaboration, enabling effective tracking and sharing of SQL scripts and project progress.
